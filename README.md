# CounterApp

This project is a simple counter application created as part of the Mobile Computing Laboratory assignment. Developed in Swift using SwiftUI, this app allows users to increment a counter with each tap and reset it to zero with a dedicated button.


# Project Snapshot

### The images below illustrate various states of the counter:

- Initial State (Count = 0)
- Incremented State (Count = 8 and 119)
- Reset State (Count = 0 after reset)
